While you're casually working on your PC, you're surprised by a bunch of ants in your PC's inner parts, working hard to destroy them. So you grab your gun and get in there to SEARCH AND DESTROY every last one of them. But be careful... some of these ants were struck by cosmic lightning and now they're HUNTING YOU DOWN.
